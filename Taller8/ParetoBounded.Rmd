## [80-20 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution)

>The Pareto principle or "80-20 rule" stating that 80% of outcomes
>are due to 20% of causes was named in honour of Pareto,
>but the concepts are distinct, and only Pareto distributions
>with shape value (α) of log45 ≈ 1.16 precisely reflect it.
